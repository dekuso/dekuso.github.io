Hello, welcome to my blog!\
I am just some guy in his twenties trying to figure out what life is all about and what my purpose is.\
My posts don't follow a certain theme and they are just some thoughts that float around in my head.

Most of my posts now are in German but I intend to write some in English too.

You can follow me in the fediverse: @dekuso@mastodon.online\
On instagram: <a href="https://instagram.com/de.ku.so/">@de.ku.so</a>\
Or you can subscribe to my RSS-Feed: https://dekuso.blog/feed\
If you want to contact me you can write me an <a href="mailto:dekusosblog@protonmail.com">email</a> or just write me a PM on Mastodon.
