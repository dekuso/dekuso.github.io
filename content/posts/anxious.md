We sat down at the table.\
"Dont look her in the eyes. Dont speak. I dont want to live".\
These thoughts passed my mind while we waited for the waitress. \
I felt uncomfortable.\
I tried to escape from this world and be apart from our group, my gaze going distant. Avoiding to take part in their conversations. Just saying a word if I had to, because secretly I wanted to vanish and nobody should acknowledge my existence by forcing me to return to the real world.

I knew it was my anxiety but it is still exhausting every single time.
