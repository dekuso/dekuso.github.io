The door was extraordinarily ordinary. I looked at her with some suspicion. It was just another door, but was it? How come that I have never noticed it before. The room we were in was not lit by any source of light but the door still had some certain glow to it. Warm yellow light was reflected by the eggshell white door. The knob didn't fit with the rest of the image of the door. It was shining bright like it was switched out recently.\
I was hesitant.\
Where does this door lead to?\
Will I get hurt if I open it?\
But there is no other way to go...\
I cannot go back anymore.
