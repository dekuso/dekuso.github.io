description: "I wish i could leave my body"
---

I wish i could leave my body, transcend out of it and leave behind what i am not. Just becoming pure energy of what i am and creating my own vessel.\
I feel guilt for who i am and for not accepting me in every way. I feel small.\
Constantly changing like currents.\
Sometimes I wish for not coming tears to bring me closer to my salvation. Washing off the dirt of unasked answers of early times.\
Hoping for a good laugh and never ending love of myself.\
Maybe it is not time yet
